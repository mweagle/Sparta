## Overview

Sparta takes a set of _golang_ functions and automatically provisions them in
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) as a logical unit.

AWS Lambda functions are defined using the standard [AWS Lambda signatures](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-go-support-for-aws-lambda/):

- `func()`
- `func() error`
- `func(TIn) error`
- `func() (TOut, error)`
- `func(context.Context) error`
- `func(context.Context, TIn) error`
- `func(context.Context) (TOut, error)`
- `func(context.Context, TIn) (TOut, error)`

The TIn and TOut parameters represent encoding/json un/marshallable types.

For instance:

```go
// Standard AWS Î» function
func helloWorld(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
  ...
}
```

where

- `ctx` : The request context that includes both the [AWS Context](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/blob/master/lambdacontext/context.go) as well as Sparta specific [values](https://godoc.org/github.com/mweagle/Sparta#pkg-constants.)

Consumers define a set of lambda functions and provide them to Sparta to create a self-documenting, self-deploying AWS Lambda binary:

```go
  lambdaFn, _ := sparta.NewAWSLambda("Hello World",
    helloWorld,
    sparta.IAMRoleDefinition{})

  var lambdaFunctions []*sparta.LambdaAWSInfo
  lambdaFunctions = append(lambdaFunctions, lambdaFn)

  err := sparta.Main("HelloWorldStack",
    "My Hello World stack",
    lambdaFunctions,
    nil,
    nil)
```

### Building

Locally building or testing Sparta itself is typically only needed to make package
changes. Sparta is more often used as a required import of another application.
Building is done via [mage](https://magefile.org/).

To get started building and verifying local changes:

1. `go get -u -d github.com/magefile/mage`
1. In the .../mweagle/Sparta directory, run `mage -l` to list the current targets:

```
\$ mage -l
Targets:
build the application
clean the working directory
compareAgainstMasterBranch is a convenience function to show the comparisons of the current pushed branch against the master branch
describe runs the `TestDescribe` test to generate a describe HTML output file at graph.html
docsBuild builds the public documentation site in the /docs folder
docsCommit builds and commits the current documentation with an autogenerated comment
docsEdit starts a Hugo server and hot reloads the documentation at http://localhost:1313
docsInstallRequirements installs the required Hugo version
ensureAllPreconditions ensures that the source passes _ALL_ static `ensure*` precondition steps
ensureCleanTree ensures that the git tree is clean
ensureFormatted ensures that the source code is formatted with goimports
ensureGoFmt ensures that the source is `gofmt -s` is empty
ensureLint ensures that the source is `golint`ed
ensureMarkdownSpelling ensures that all \*.MD files are checked for common spelling mistakes
ensurePrealloc ensures that slices that could be preallocated are enforced
ensureSpelling ensures that there are no misspellings in the source
ensureStaticChecks ensures that the source code passes static code checks
ensureTravisBuildEnvironment is the command that sets up the Travis environment to run the build.
ensureVet ensures that the source has been `go vet`ted
generateBuildInfo creates the automatic buildinfo.go file so that we can stamp the SHA into the binaries we build...
generateConstants runs the set of commands that update the embedded CONSTANTS for both local and AWS Lambda execution
installBuildRequirements installs or updates the dependent packages that aren't referenced by the source, but are needed to build the Sparta source
logCodeMetrics ensures that the source code is formatted with goimports
publish the latest source
test runs the Sparta tests
testCover runs the test and opens up the resulting report
travisBuild is the task to build in the context of a Travis CI pipeline
```
Confirm tests are passing on `HEAD` by first running `mage -v test`.

As you periodically make local changes, run `mage -v test` to confirm backward compatibility.

### Tests

When possible, please include a [test case](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) that verifies the local change and ensures compatibility.
