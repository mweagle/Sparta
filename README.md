## Overview

Sparta takes a set of _golang_ functions and automatically provisions them in
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) as a logical unit.

AWS Lambda functions are defined using the standard [AWS Lambda signatures](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-go-support-for-aws-lambda/):

* `func()`
* `func() error`
* `func(TIn) error`
* `func() (TOut, error)`
* `func(context.Context) error`
* `func(context.Context, TIn) error`
* `func(context.Context) (TOut, error)`
* `func(context.Context, TIn) (TOut, error)`

 The TIn and TOut parameters represent encoding/json un/marshallable types.

For instance:

```go
// Standard AWS λ function
func helloWorld(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
  ...
}
```

where
  * `ctx` : The request context that includes both the [AWS Context](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/blob/master/lambdacontext/context.go) as well as Sparta specific [values](https://godoc.org/github.com/mweagle/Sparta#pkg-constants.)


Consumers define a set of lambda functions and provide them to Sparta to create a self-documenting, self-deploying AWS Lambda binary:

```go
	lambdaFn, _ := sparta.NewAWSLambda("Hello World",
		helloWorld,
		sparta.IAMRoleDefinition{})

	var lambdaFunctions []*sparta.LambdaAWSInfo
	lambdaFunctions = append(lambdaFunctions, lambdaFn)

	err := sparta.Main("HelloWorldStack",
		"My Hello World stack",
		lambdaFunctions,
		nil,
		nil)
```

### Building

Locally building or testing Sparta itself is typically only needed to make package
changes. Sparta is more often used as a required import of another application.
Building is done via [mage](https://magefile.org/).

To get started building and verifying local changes:

  1. `go get -u -d github.com/magefile/mage`
  1. In the .../mweagle/Sparta directory, run `mage -l` to list the current targets:

	$ mage -l
	Targets:
	  build                           the application
	  clean                           the working directory
	  compareAgainstMasterBranch      is a convenience function to show the comparisons of the current pushed branch against the master branch
	  describe                        runs the `TestDescribe` test to generate a describe HTML output file at graph.html
	  docsBuild                       builds the public documentation site in the /docs folder
	  docsCommit                      builds and commits the current documentation with an autogenerated comment
	  docsEdit                        starts a Hugo server and hot reloads the documentation at http://localhost:1313
	  docsInstallRequirements         installs the required Hugo version
	  ensureAllPreconditions          ensures that the source passes *ALL* static `ensure*` precondition steps
	  ensureCleanTree                 ensures that the git tree is clean
	  ensureFormatted                 ensures that the source code is formatted with goimports
	  ensureGoFmt                     ensures that the source is `gofmt -s` is empty
	  ensureLint                      ensures that the source is `golint`ed
	  ensureMarkdownSpelling          ensures that all *.MD files are checked for common spelling mistakes
	  ensurePrealloc                  ensures that slices that could be preallocated are enforced
	  ensureSpelling                  ensures that there are no misspellings in the source
	  ensureStaticChecks              ensures that the source code passes static code checks
	  ensureTravisBuildEnvironment    is the command that sets up the Travis environment to run the build.
	  ensureVet                       ensures that the source has been `go vet`ted
	  generateBuildInfo               creates the automatic buildinfo.go file so that we can stamp the SHA into the binaries we build...
	  generateConstants               runs the set of commands that update the embedded CONSTANTS for both local and AWS Lambda execution
	  installBuildRequirements        installs or updates the dependent packages that aren't referenced by the source, but are needed to build the Sparta source
	  logCodeMetrics                  ensures that the source code is formatted with goimports
	  publish                         the latest source
	  test                            runs the Sparta tests
	  testCover                       runs the test and opens up the resulting report
	  travisBuild                     is the task to build in the context of a Travis CI pipeline

Confirm tests are passing on `HEAD` by first running `mage -v test`.

As you periodically make local changes, run `mage -v test` to confirm backward compatibility.

### Tests

When possible, please include a [test case](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) that verifies the local change and ensures compatibility.
