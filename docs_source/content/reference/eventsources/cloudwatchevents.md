In this section we'll walkthrough how to trigger your lambda function in response to different types of [CloudWatch Events](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cloudwatch-events-track-and-respond-to-changes-to-your-aws-resources/). This overview is based on the [SpartaApplication](https://github.com/mweagle/SpartaApplication) sample code if you'd rather jump to the end result.

# Goal

Assume that we're supposed to write a simple "HelloWorld" CloudWatch event function that has two requirements:

- Run every _5 minutes_ to provide a heartbeat notification to our alerting system via a logfile entry
- Log _EC2-related_ events for later processing

## Getting Started

The lambda function is relatively small:

```go
func echoCloudWatchEvent(ctx context.Context, event map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
  logger, _ := ctx.Value(sparta.ContextKeyRequestLogger).(*zerolog.Logger)

  logger.Info().
    Interface("Event", event).
    Msg("Event received")

  return event, nil
}
```

Our lambda function doesn't need to do much with the event other than log and return it.

## Sparta Integration {#spartaIntegration}

With `echoCloudWatchEvent()` implemented, the next step is to integrate the **go** function with Sparta. This is done by the `appendCloudWatchEventHandler` in the SpartaApplication [application.go](https://github.com/mweagle/SpartaApplication/blob/master/application.go) source.

Our lambda function only needs logfile write privileges, and since these are enabled by default, we can use an empty `sparta.IAMRoleDefinition` value:

```go
func appendCloudWatchEventHandler(api *sparta.API,
	lambdaFunctions []*sparta.LambdaAWSInfo) []*sparta.LambdaAWSInfo {

	lambdaFn, _ := sparta.NewAWSLambda(sparta.LambdaName(echoCloudWatchEvent),
		echoCloudWatchEvent,
		sparta.IAMRoleDefinition{})
```

The next step is to add a `CloudWatchEventsPermission` value that includes the two rule triggers.

```go
cloudWatchEventsPermission := sparta.CloudWatchEventsPermission{}
cloudWatchEventsPermission.Rules = make(map[string]sparta.CloudWatchEventsRule, 0)
```

Our two rules will be inserted into the `Rules` map in the next steps.

### Cron Expression

Our first requirement is that the lambda function write a heartbeat to the logfile every 5 mins. This can be configured by adding a scheduled event:

```go
cloudWatchEventsPermission.Rules["Rate5Mins"] = sparta.CloudWatchEventsRule{
  ScheduleExpression: "rate(5 minutes)",
}
```

The `ScheduleExpression` value can either be a _rate_ or a _cron_ [expression](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/ScheduledEvents.html). The map keyname is used when adding the [rule](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/CloudWatchEvents.html#putRule-property) during stack provisioning.

### Event Pattern

The other requirement is that our lambda function be notified when matching EC2 events are created. To support this, we'll add a second `Rule`:

```go
cloudWatchEventsPermission.Rules["EC2Activity"] = sparta.CloudWatchEventsRule{
  EventPattern: map[string]interface{}{
    "source":      []string{"aws.ec2"},
    "detail-type": []string{"EC2 Instance State-change Notification"},
  },
}
```

The EC2 event pattern is the **go** JSON-compatible representation of the event pattern that CloudWatch Events will use to trigger our lambda function. This structured value will be marshaled to a String during CloudFormation Template marshaling.

{{% notice warning %}}
Sparta does <b>NOT</b> attempt to validate either <code>ScheduleExpression</code> or <code>EventPattern</code> values prior to calling CloudFormation. Syntax errors in either value will be detected during provisioning when the Sparta CloudFormation CustomResource calls <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/CloudWatchEvents.html#putRule-property">putRule</a> to add the lambda target. This error will cause the CloudFormation operation to fail. Any API errors will be logged & are viewable in the <a href="https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/application-management/post/TxPYD8JT4CB5UY/View-CloudFormation-Logs-in-the-Console">CloudFormation Logs Console</a>.

## Add Permission

With the two rules configured, the final step is to add the `sparta.CloudWatchPermission` to our `sparta.LambdaAWSInfo` value:

```go
lambdaFn.Permissions = append(lambdaFn.Permissions, cloudWatchEventsPermission)
return append(lambdaFunctions, lambdaFn)
```

Our entire function is therefore:

```go
func appendCloudWatchEventHandler(api *sparta.API,
	lambdaFunctions []*sparta.LambdaAWSInfo) []*sparta.LambdaAWSInfo {

	lambdaFn, _ := sparta.NewAWSLambda(sparta.LambdaName(echoCloudWatchEvent),
		echoCloudWatchEvent,
		sparta.IAMRoleDefinition{})

	cloudWatchEventsPermission := sparta.CloudWatchEventsPermission{}
	cloudWatchEventsPermission.Rules = make(map[string]sparta.CloudWatchEventsRule, 0)
	cloudWatchEventsPermission.Rules["Rate5Mins"] = sparta.CloudWatchEventsRule{
		ScheduleExpression: "rate(5 minutes)",
	}
	cloudWatchEventsPermission.Rules["EC2Activity"] = sparta.CloudWatchEventsRule{
		EventPattern: map[string]interface{}{
			"source":      []string{"aws.ec2"},
			"detail-type": []string{"EC2 Instance state change"},
		},
	}
	lambdaFn.Permissions = append(lambdaFn.Permissions, cloudWatchEventsPermission)
	return append(lambdaFunctions, lambdaFn)
}
```

# Wrapping Up

With the `lambdaFn` fully defined, we can provide it to `sparta.Main()` and deploy our service. The workflow below is shared by all CloudWatch Events-triggered lambda functions:

- Define the lambda function (`echoCloudWatchEvent`).
- If needed, create the required [IAMRoleDefinition](https://godoc.org/github.com/mweagle/Sparta*IAMRoleDefinition) with appropriate privileges.
- Provide the lambda function & IAMRoleDefinition to `sparta.NewAWSLambda()`
- Create a [CloudWatchEventsPermission](https://godoc.org/github.com/mweagle/Sparta#CloudWatchEventsPermission) value.
- Add one or more [CloudWatchEventsRules](https://godoc.org/github.com/mweagle/Sparta#CloudWatchEventsRule) to the `CloudWatchEventsPermission.Rules` map that define your lambda function's trigger condition:
  - [Scheduled Events](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/ScheduledEvents.html)
  - [Event Patterns](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CloudWatchEventsandEventPatterns.html)
- Append the `CloudWatchEventsPermission` value to the lambda function's `Permissions` slice.
- Include the reference in the call to `sparta.Main()`.
